#Art Supplies Catalog App

This app is a web-based catalog that shows items in a variety of categories. It also has a secure user registration and authentication system. User can read items from a database, while registered users can also create, edit, and delete items.


###How to Use

The app is currently being hosted [here](http://ec2-35-164-186-33.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com). You don't have to register to view the catalog, simply click on the category you wish to browse. Create an account by logging in with either facebook or google. Once logged in you can also create a new item by clicking on the create item button, and edit and delete items that you have created by clicking on the edit or delete links under the item description.
